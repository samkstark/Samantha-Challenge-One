# Samantha-Challenge-One

## Description
Samantha-Challenge-One was created to refactor the starter code we were given in class. The goal was to make the code for the Horiseon website main page more accessible. This was done by replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic ones. The CSS stylesheet was also refactored so that the repetitive code was consolidated and comments were added to each section. This challenge taught me about HTML semantic elements, and how to track elements and changes between the index.html and CSS. I also learned the importance of adding alt ID's onto images to improve accessability for users who cannot see the image.
